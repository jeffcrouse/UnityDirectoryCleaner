# UnityDirectoryCleaner

delete non-essential files and folders from all of the Unity projects in a particular directory

## WARNING

Not recommended for actual usage by anyone but me because it "rm -rf"s on your machine. But maybe it will be helpful to look at it. 

## Install

``npm install``

## Usage

``node index.js ~/Unity`` 

where ~/Unity is the directory that contains all of the Unity projects. 

## TO DO

- Implement https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander
